#Tera Recorder

Simply place the module inside of your toolbox and reload the game.
After that any actions you take in the game will be recorded on your machine locally.

##Function

This module's purpose is to preserve as much of your account data for yourself so you can easily recreate it later on any server.
Any private server will be able to fully recreate your characters using these logs.

###Advice

The more stuff you do in the game, the more data there will be.
Character selection is enough to have all of your look info but don't stop there.
Log into your character.
Open inventory.
Open bank.
Open your Wardrobe.
Etc...
The more data you give, the easier it will be for someone to recreate it in the future.

####Disclaimer

I don't get any of this data.
The source is open. It is saved solely on your PC for the sake of future recreation/remembering of the memories.

Eventually I will open source the replayer as well so you can revisit your memories, however I want to make it more user friendly before doing so.
